Modern computing and the internet have made accessible a vast amount of information. The ability to efficiently search through this information is fundamental to computation. This chapter describes classical searching algorithms that have proven to be effective in numerous applications for decades. We use the term symbol table to describe an abstract mechanism where we save information (a value) that we can later search for and retrieve by specifying a key.
